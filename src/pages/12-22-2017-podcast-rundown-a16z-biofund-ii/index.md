For my first blog post I'm going to be summarizing a16z's Taking the Pulse on Bio podcast

###The takeaway

"We are looking for companies where the science risk has been removed or greatly derisked" - [@Vijay](twitter.com/VijayPande)

Bio Technology Trajectory

Impossible -> Possible -> Routine -> Indispensable

Example given is Genome Sequencing.
a16z believes there are opportunities early in this cycle

You can split the bio space into two categories of companies: high science risk and low Science risk companies. a16z's biofund is looking for companies where science risk is a small proportion of their overall risk and instead their risk is mainly composed of engineering and scale risks. This archetype of company looks a lot like a startup and that's why a16z thinks it can help these companies most.

###The rundown

There is a crucial shift in the way biological advances will be made and a16z wants to help the companies who change the way bio is done and make profits while doing so.The Shift is from empirical science to an engineering discipline for Bio

Before we talk about the future of bio let's talk about the way it's being practiced now. 
1. Our understanding of underlying biological mechanisms is limited

2. Developing new therapies is costly wrt time and capital

3. â€ŽTechniques used in one domain of bio are not easily transferred to others.

#####The solution

Apply engineering techniques to bio specifically from the domains of ML/AI

1. ML/AI techniques can function in poorly understood systems and still produce new knowledge and actionable insights. Freenome uses AI to understand the relationship between the poorly understood immune signals in the blood and certain cancers allowing people to get early treatment

2. For illnesses where the cause is well understood (example given sickle cell anemia) then engineering approaches using tools such as CRISPR and Gene Therapy can accelerate the speed of development of new therapies.

3. Plug and Play nature of CRISPR and modern therapies compared to bespoke drug, you just alter the genetic code that you write

######Sickle Cell vs Alzheimers

How AI can help develop treatments when we do and don't have underlying knowledge of the involved biological processes.

The cause of sickle cell anemia is known : a mutation in hemaglobin that causes red blood cells to become sickle (fold) in order to build a therapy for sickle cell you'd need to either repair or replace hemaglobin to prevent folding of your red blood cells. The engineering approaches to creating this Therapy are CRISPR or Gene Therapy.

In contrast we have a poor understanding of what drives Alzheimer's and so people have to hypothesize on what they think the best point of intervention is. They hypothesize, experiment, test and they are most likely to fail, worse still they fail later into the process at phase 3 trial - which is expensive and time-consuming.


#####On The FDA

The partners found that FDA was helpful legislatively in allowing innovations in healthspace. E.g. first gene therapy approval and first digital health treatment approval. 
"Regulatory risk is a euphemism for scientific risk."
 Gene therapy was believed to be incredibly risky but was shown to be very effective in treating a form of inheritable blindness so that the FDA panel approved the treatment unanimously - a 13-0 vote

#####On Network Effects

PatientPing - Reduces patient risk. Let's HC providers know when one of their patients get treatment at any other provider. The more subscribers and providers they have the more granularly you can track your patients

Network Effects make companies more defendable. Data network effects are newer than parents. Freenome or Cardiogram get more data with more customers then their tests get more accurate then they get a better product which gets them more customers

The patent window is shrinking and the data network effect never goes off patent

###Opportunities

**Application of AI techniques**
* Dermatology
* Retinal screening
* Facial analysis for genetic diseases
* Analysing Pulse from an Apple watch to diagnose heart conditions

**Non AI techniques**
* Crispr
* Gene Therapy
* Cell Therapy
* Gene Sequencing price and duration reduction


####Testing/Trial Opportunities

Phase 3 Drug Trials, after much time and capital are invested, is where a lot of new therapies fail. There are developments to make testing of therapies more efficient before you get to human trials as well as after.

The problem is that cell tests in labs and animal models (the preclinical phase) are poor predictors of human success. Animals can be replaced by "organs on chips or humans on chips" that allow for better prediction of being beneficial to humans.

There will also be less volunteers needed for human trials. With more targeted drugs you need more specific patients which means higher signal to noise ratio. Recruiting for trials is also made easier. Facebook partnered with the Michael J Fox foundation to pilot FB as a tool to recruit patients for a Parkinson's disease trial, this lead to a 96% cost + time reduction in finding trial patients.
(I couldn't find a reference to this partnership in the news)

####Digital health Opportunities

Vijay: The opportunity is that you can design therapeutics that have no toxicity. Behavioural therapy is very expensive and hard to scale e.g. The CDC's diabetes prevention program. [Omada](https://www.omadahealth.com/) can take these established therapies and engineer + scale it + A/B test it at scale. A/B testing is the tech equivalent of clinical trials. The challenge with this opportunity is finding the areas where you can make a similar impact apart from Type 2 diabetes

###My notes

Vijay really emphasizes having the domain expertise in biology and computer science. [Gabe](twitter.com/gabeotte) of [Freenome](freenome.com) worked at Apple as a SE in addition to studying molecular biology
