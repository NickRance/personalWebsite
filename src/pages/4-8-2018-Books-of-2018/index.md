Many of my Professors have an immense respect for JFK so I picked up a short read to learn a bit about this presidency and I now share their sentiments towards him. What I admired about JFK is his fortitude against the pressure of the Washington establishment. After the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK fully understood that his decisions had existential consequences for millions of people in the Soviet Union, in the United States and even in Cuba. Furthermore, he learned that military advice from his generals could be deeply flawed.

>*"Train Cuban Exiles they said, they'll never know about US involvement they said!" -JFK, probably*

JFK refocused his administration around seeking diplomatic solutions which was difficult given how tense the public was. He was subsequently criticized as appeasing the Soviets, conceding too often. But he remained resilient and defied the zero-sum thinking that characterized Cold War politics. He empathized with his 'enemy' in negotiations understanding that Khrushchev wanted to improve conditions for his people just as much as he did. He understood that there was a way for both countries to 'win' and he looked aggressively for that path.

I can't find the quote for the life of me but it's to the tune of:
>*'I'm not trying to humiliate Khrushchev, I'm trying to strike a deal where we can both go back to our home countries with a victory in hand'*

Now that's a President who could write a book called "The Art of the Deal"
