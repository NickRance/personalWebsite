Hey There! My name is Nicholas F. Rance. I'm 23 years old and I live in New York where I work full-time on my start-up [RoundRobin](http://www.roundrobin.tech)

I'm interested in the application of Data Science to build smarter systems.

The use of Artificial Intelligence to automate tasks

Biotech to help people live better and longer

Development Economics to help close the gap between the developed and the developing world

Blockchain Technology as a way of establish truth in a postmodern 21st Century

In my spare time I go Scuba Diving and Rock Climbing.

I'm also an avid League of Legends Esports Fan. #C9Win
