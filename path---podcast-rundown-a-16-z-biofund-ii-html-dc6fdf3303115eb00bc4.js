This archetype of company looks a lot like a startup and that\'s why a16z thinks it can help these companies most.</p>\n<h3>The rundown</h3>\n<p>There is a crucial shift in the way biological advances will be made and a16z wants to help the companies who change the way bio is done and make profits while doing so.The Shift is from empirical science to an engineering discipline for Bio</p>\n<p>Before we talk about the future of bio let\'s talk about the way it\'s being practiced now.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Our understanding of underlying biological mechanisms is limited</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Developing new therapies is costly wrt time and capital</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>‎Techniques used in one domain of bio are not easily transferred to others.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>The solution</h5>\n<p>Apply engineering techniques to bio specifically from the domains of ML/AI</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>ML/AI techniques can function in poorly understood systems and still produce new knowledge and actionable insights. Freenome uses AI to understand the relationship between the poorly understood immune signals in the blood and certain cancers allowing people to get early treatment</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For illnesses where the cause is well understood (example given sickle cell anemia) then engineering approaches using tools such as CRISPR and Gene Therapy can accelerate the speed of development of new therapies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Plug and Play nature of CRISPR and modern therapies compared to bespoke drug, you just alter the genetic code that you write</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h6>Sickle Cell vs Alzheimers</h6>\n<p>How AI can help develop treatments when we do and don\'t have underlying knowledge of the involved biological processes.</p>\n<p>The cause of sickle cell anemia is known : a mutation in hemaglobin that causes red blood cells to become sickle (fold) in order to build a therapy for sickle cell you\'d need to either repair or replace hemaglobin to prevent folding of your red blood cells. The engineering approaches to creating this Therapy are CRISPR or Gene Therapy.</p>\n<p>In contrast we have a poor understanding of what drives Alzheimer\'s and so people have to hypothesize on what they think the best point of intervention is. They hypothesize, experiment, test and they are most likely to fail, worse still they fail later into the process at phase 3 trial - which is expensive and time-consuming.</p>\n<h5>On The FDA</h5>\n<p>The partners found that FDA was helpful legislatively in allowing innovations in healthspace. E.g. first gene therapy approval and first digital health treatment approval.\n"Regulatory risk is a euphemism for scientific risk."\nGene therapy was believed to be incredibly risky but was shown to be very effective in treating a form of inheritable blindness so that the FDA panel approved the treatment unanimously - a 13-0 vote</p>\n<h5>On Network Effects</h5>\n<p>PatientPing - Reduces patient risk. Let\'s HC providers know when one of their patients get treatment at any other provider. The more subscribers and providers they have the more granularly they can track their patients</p>\n<p>Network Effects make companies more defendable. Data network effects are newer than parents. Freenome or Cardiogram get more data with more customers then their tests get more accurate then they get a better product which gets them more customers</p>\n<p>The patent window is shrinking and the data network effect never goes off patent</p>\n<h3>Opportunities</h3>\n<p><strong>Application of AI techniques</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dermatology</li>\n<li>Retinal screening</li>\n<li>Facial analysis for genetic diseases</li>\n<li>Analysing Pulse from an Apple watch to diagnose heart conditions</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Non AI techniques</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crispr</li>\n<li>Gene Therapy</li>\n<li>Cell Therapy</li>\n<li>Gene Sequencing price and duration reduction</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Testing/Trial Opportunities</h4>\n<p>Phase 3 Drug Trials, after much time and capital are invested, is where a lot of new therapies fail. There are developments to make testing of therapies more efficient before you get to human trials as well as after.</p>\n<p>The problem is that cell tests in labs and animal models (the preclinical phase) are poor predictors of human success. Animals can be replaced by "organs on chips or humans on chips" that allow for better prediction of being beneficial to humans.</p>\n<p>There will also be less volunteers needed for human trials. With more targeted drugs you need more specific patients which means higher signal to noise ratio. Recruiting for trials is also made easier. Facebook partnered with the Michael J Fox foundation to pilot FB as a tool to recruit patients for a Parkinson\'s disease trial, this lead to a 96% cost + time reduction in finding trial patients.\n(I couldn\'t find a reference to this partnership in the news)</p>\n<h4>Digital health Opportunities</h4>\n<p>Vijay: The opportunity is that you can design therapeutics that have no toxicity. Behavioural therapy is very expensive and hard to scale e.g. The CDC\'s diabetes prevention program. <a href="https://www.omadahealth.com/">Omada</a> can take these established therapies and engineer + scale it + A/B test it at scale. A/B testing is the tech equivalent of clinical trials. The challenge with this opportunity is finding the areas where you can make a similar impact apart from Type 2 diabetes</p>\n<h3>My notes</h3>\n<p>Vijay really emphasizes having the domain expertise in biology and computer science. <a href="//twitter.com/gabeotte">Gabe</a> of <a href="//freenome.com">Freenome</a> worked at Apple as a SE in addition to studying molecular biology</p>',frontmatter:{date:"December 22, 2017",path:"/podcast-rundown-a16z-biofund-ii.html",tags:["bio"],title:"Podcast Rundown: a16z on it's second bio fund"}}},pathContext:{prev:{excerpt:"To Move The World - J.Sachs Many of my Professors have an immense respect for JFK so I picked up a short read to learn a bit about this presidency and I now share their sentiments towards him.

What I admired about JFK is his fortitude against the pressure of the Washington establishment. After the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK fully understood that his decisions had existential consequences for millions of people in the Soviet Union, in the United States and even in Cuba. Furthermore, he learned that military advice from his generals could be deeply flawed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>"Train Cuban Exiles they said, they\'ll never know about US involvement they said!" -JFK, probably</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JFK refocused his administration around seeking diplomatic solutions which was difficult given how tense the public was. He was subsequently criticized as appeasing the Soviets, conceding too often. But he remained resilient and defied the zero-sum thinking that characterized Cold War politics. He empathized with his \'enemy\' in negotiations understanding that Khrushchev wanted to improve conditions for his people just as much as he did. He understood that there was a way for both countries to \'win\' and he looked aggressively for that path.</p>\n<p>I can\'t find the quote for the life of me but it\'s to the tune of:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\'I\'m not trying to humiliate Khrushchev, I\'m trying to strike a deal where we can both go back to our home countries with a victory in hand\'</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now that\'s a President who could write a book called "The Art of the Deal"</p>\n<h3>Just Mercy - Bryan Stevenson</h3>\n<a href="//youtu.be/x5DfVmtKgzw">\n<img src="https://assets.uua.org/sites/live-new.uua.org/files/styles/scaled_960_wide/public/justmercy-web-cropped_0.jpg" alt="To Move The World" style="width:400px">\n</a>\n<h3>Black Swan - Nassim Nicholas Taleb</h3>\n<img src="http://www.inboundandagile.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Black-Swan-226x348.jpg" alt="To Move The World" style="width:400px">',id:"/home/nick-dev/workspace/projects/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/4-8-2018-Books-of-2018/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2018-04-08T03:49:16.408Z",path:"/2018-Books.html",tags:["Books, 2018"],title:"Books of 2018"}},next:{excerpt:"Hey There!
